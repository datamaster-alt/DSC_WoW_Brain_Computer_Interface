# DSC_WoW_Brain_Computer_Interface



## Objective

To provide a better and efficient solution to the problems faced by the bedriden especially the paralysed patients.

The system that we proposed utilizes the widely used and non -invasive eeg capturing technology to develop an assistance to the paralysed patients.


## About The Project

Every bedridden patients in the community expectialy the group of  disebled individuals like  paralysed patients need help of other in on way or other.Sometimes even the relatives fail to reach out to emergency need of the patients.Our system is to solve some of the problems faced by the bed ridden patients.

We uses brain computer interface to develop an assistance for the patients.

This system helps the patient to control his bed and control the electrical appliances in the room and calls for help  using eye blink or attention level.
